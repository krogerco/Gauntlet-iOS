/// Asserts that the queue that this function is called on is the expected queue. This is useful for validating APIs that take callback queues to ensure
/// that it always calls back on the provided queue.
///
///     // Given
///     let provider =  ...
///     let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "A Custom Queue")
///     let expectation = self.expectation(description: "Request should complete")
///
///     // When, Then
///     provider.getData(queue: queue) { result in
///         XCTAssertOnQueue(queue)
///         ...
///     }
///
///     waitForExpectations(timeout: 5)
///
/// - Note:
///     This function compares the label of the provided queue to the label of the queue that this function was called on. When using this to validate the behavior of
///     a piece of code is is recommended that you create your own queue for the test that you inject in to the code to be tested to ensure that you have a queue
///     with a unique label of your own creation.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - expression: An expression that returns a `DispatchQueue` that this function is expected to be called on.
///   - message:    An optional description of the failure.
///   - reporter:   The `FailureReporter` to report a failure to. The default reporter will report the failure with XCTest.
///   - file:       The file in which failure occurred. Defaults to the file name of the test case in which this function was called.
///   - line:       The line number on which failure occurred. Defaults to the line number on which this function was called.
///   - then:       A closure to be called if on the expected queue. This can be used to run additional conditional tests.
