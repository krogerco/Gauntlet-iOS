import XCTest

/// Asserts the value is not `nil`.
///
/// This function provides the same behavior as the `XCTAssertNotNil` function provided in `XCTest` but adds a closure that's called when the value is not `nil`, providing a strongly typed non-optional reference to the property.
/// This simple addition makes tests around optional values much cleaner and easier to read by removing the need to add redundant conditional logic, guards that may prevent further tests from running, or optional chaining.
///
///     // Given
///     let jsonData = ...
///     let decoder = JSONDecoder()
///
///     // When
///     let product = try decoder.decode(Product.self, from: jsonData)
